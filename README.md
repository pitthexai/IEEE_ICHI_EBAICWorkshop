## Track II: Medical Imaging 
<p align="justify">AI fairness in medical image analysis is a critical aspect in the development of fair AI and deep learning models in healthcare settings. For instance, an accurate and reliable segmentation of medical images is essential for precise disease diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, and effective patient monitoring. However, when fairness is not adequately addressed, these AI models can inadvertently perpetuate biases and disparities in healthcare delivery. Fairness in medical image segmentation ensures that the AI algorithms do not discriminate against individuals based on their race, gender, socioeconomic status, or any other demographic factors. It aims to provide equitable healthcare outcomes for all patients, irrespective of their background or characteristics.</p>

<p align="justify">Upholding fairness in AI models for medical image segmentation is not only an ethical imperative but also crucial for building trust in AI systems within the medical community and among patients. Transparent and accountable AI algorithms, coupled with comprehensive data collection and evaluation, can help identify and rectify biases present in the training data or the algorithmic decision-making process. This iterative process of refinement and evaluation ensures that AI models produce consistent and equitable results, contributing to the overall quality and fairness of healthcare delivery. The current <a href="https://pittnail.github.io/EBAIC" target="_blank"><strong>Tutorial/Hackathon</strong></a> mainly aims to provide hands-on-practices in building fair and unbiased deep learning image segmentation in knee/hip bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs.</p>

### Dataset
<p align="justify">We will be using knee/hip radiographs (X-rays) that are publicly available through the <a href="https://nda.nih.gov/oai" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI)</a>. You may want to create an account there and download knee/hip X-ray images. However, in this GitHub repository, we provide you with a sample subset of the images with manual segmentation masks. During the tutorial, we will be mainly using this sample data.</p>
